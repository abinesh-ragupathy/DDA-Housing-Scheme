# DDA-Housing-Scheme
  Affordable housing is a common point of concern throughout India. This issue is more pronounced in the capital Delhi, due to its high population density and limitation on resources.

  DDA (Delhi Development Authority) is committed to provide affordable houses for residents. It has a target of completing fifty thousand houses every year. DDA is responsible for construction of new houses and providing it to residents through its Housing Schemes, which are launched every two to three years.
  
  These houses are provided at multiple locations; these are available under multiple categories, sizes and price. Anyone, who does not own a residential property in Delhi can apply for one house. The applicant needs to provide its order of preference (up to three) with respect to the Category, Size and Location of the property.
  
  After consolidating all valid applications, DDA runs a lottery for allocation of houses. The result is published in major newspapers and also on their website. The successful applicants get notification letter, and proceed with further processing (and allotment).
